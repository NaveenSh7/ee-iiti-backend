        "The research work by the Ph.D. student was aimed towards understanding the impact of back gate bias on the occurrence of steep and dynamic subthreshold swing in junctionless double gate transistors operated in the asymmetric mode. The phenomenon, due to impact ionization, was elucidated through the ratio between minimum hole concentration and peak electron concentration, and the dynamic change in the location of the conduction channel with applied front gate voltage. In terms of on-to-off current ratio, the asymmetric mode operation with a subthreshold swing of ~19 mV/decade, was shown to perform significantly better than a symmetric mode operation. Results highlighted opportunities for exploring asymmetric operation towards achieving steep swing with junctionless transistors. The bipolar phenomenon in unipolar junctionless transistors can be useful for dynamic memory and transistor-based biosensors."

        "A relevant application for tunnel transistor is the implementation of capacitorless dynamic random-access memory (1T-DRAM). To explore the same, the PhD student analyzed a twin gate tunnel field effect transistor was utilized to function as 1T-DRAM with improved retention characteristics. The design incorporated essential aspects for capturing dynamic memory operation i.e. first gate of the twin gate architecture was utilized to regulate the read mechanism based on band-to-band tunneling whereas the second gate created and maintained a dedicated volume for charge storage near the drain region. The profound well along with the optimized biases aid to attain a retention time (RT) of ∼1.5 s at 85 °C. Systematic analysis showed the scalability of the storage region to 50 nm with further improvement in RT by using an underlap region between drain and second gate. The topology was shown to exhibit higher retention at elevated temperatures (125 °C). Further improvement could be achieved through the optimal design of individual lengths while maintaining retention greater than 64 ms at 85 °C along with a decent current ratio.",
        "The evolution of transistor architecture i.e.  from single gate transistor to multiple gates has been beneficial for CMOS technologies. The path, in the initial days of evolution and technology development, witnessed several imperfections, and CMOS technology was been able to overcome these through process ingenuity. One such imperfection was the misalignment between front and back gates in a planar CMOS technology. While misalignment between front and back gates is often considered as a disadvantage due to loss of gate controllability, the research work of the Ph.D. student highlighted the usefulness and applicability of ‘imperfection’ in nanoscale junctionless devices to enhance the product of current density (J) and electric field (E) and activate impact ionization at relatively lower biases. The current density can be enhanced with gate misalignment which contributes favorably towards enhancing impact ionization. Results showed that intentionally misaligned gates in Silicon and Germanium based junctionless devices exhibit an inclined conduction channel, and achieve a nearly ideal value of steep subthreshold swing at room temperature through the maximization of (J.E). The work, while transforming an ‘intentional imperfection’ into an asset for steep switching (Fig. 5), provided new viewpoints to realize energy efficient junctionless devices through the sharp increase of drain current from off-state to on-state."

        "The relatively higher doping in the semiconductor film of a junctionless transistor impedes the adaption of the architecture for memory applications. This is mainly due to two factors: (i) the reduction of the potential well depth due to lesser extent of depletion, and (ii) reduced carrier lifetime with an increase in doping. As generated holes in a DRAM are stored in the potential well, lower depth enhances the recombination process which limits charge substance. Carrier lifetime also impedes charge retention. These limitations were addressed in a detailed study in double gate accumulation mode and junctionless transistors by a Ph.D. student. The doping dependent assessment included an analysis of storage volume, carrier lifetime, and depth of potential well to ascertain the retention characteristics of 1T-DRAM. The work showed significant impact of carrier lifetime for channel doping of 1018 cm−3 on retention Time, while the depth of potential well was critical at higher doping levels (>1018 cm−3). It was possible to achieve a retention of ~2.5 s at 85 °C with gate length of 400 nm and doping of 1017 cm−3. The retention reduced to ~90 ms at very low gate lengths 25 nm. Insights and guidelines, as a function of doping and device dimensions, were outlined for implementation of doped transistors as dynamic memory. Apart from the above, innovative junctionless architectures were examined for feasible dynamic memory operation.",
        "As junctionless transistor is heavily doped (~1019 cm-3), post-fabrication doping of the semiconductor film can be very different from the expected value. This issue has been recognized in literature and often indicated as targeted doping instead of actual (post-fabrication) doping of the semiconductor film. The estimating of doping is crucial as the current in the on-state depends on doping. Similarly, the gate work function required to deplete the semiconductor film for ensuring low current in the off-state depends on the doping. A new methodology was developed by the Ph.D. student to extract the doping of junctionless transistor using transfer characteristics which can be easily characterized. Since the doping is not known, extracting mobility was a major challenge. The proposed method utilized the evaluation of bulk mobility (μbulk) by averaging the values of transconductance (gm) between the limits of threshold (Vth) and flatband (Vfb) voltages of a junctionless device to account for bulk conduction, which was subsequently used to extract the doping from the volume current. Results showed that extracted doping was very close to the doping used in the simulations. The methodology was applied to planar (single gate and double gate) as well as non-planar devices. The work showcased the potential of a new and relatively simpler approach to estimate the doping of a junctionless transistor by utilizing DC characteristics and avoiding the capacitance measurements that often require careful de-embedding techniques.",
        "The two of the most relevant parameters for facilitating impact ionization in a transistor are gate length and drain bias. However, for three-dimensional multiple gate devices, another parameter – device cross-section is equally important. The requirements of device cross section and the associated aspect ratio were examined to facilitate steep switching in heavily doped multiple gate junctionless transistors. It was shown by a Ph.D. student that the sharp off-to-on switching action was predominantly governed by the area of cross-section of the transistor instead of the gate length. A 3-dimensional junctionless architecture preferably oriented toward a planar topology i.e. with wider fin and low aspect ratio is conducive for steep switching as a greater bulk area is available for impact ionization. On the contrary, narrow vertical architectures with aspect ratio > 1 suppress the available cross-sectional area available in the bulk of the device, and are less likely to support the steep current transition. Steep switching specific scaling methodology is showcased to attain a sharp increase in drain current with a sub-60 mV/decade swing in a tri-gate JL transistor along with an associated negative value of total gate capacitance.",
        "Logic technology for ultra low power applications requires the transistor to be operated in the subthreshold region to minimize the power consumption. Transistors designed for subthreshold logic applications are different from that required for above threshold operations. One of the approaches to limit short channel effects in junctionless transistor has been to use lateral extension of depletion region beyond the gate edge through the use of underlap design. Despite the same, the higher doping presents certain drawbacks which can be suppressed using a core-shell architecture which presents a central core region with a localized doped region at the front and back surfaces towards gate oxide. The core-shell architecture can enhance the current drive of the junctionless transistor due to the undoped central region. An analytical model was developed by the Ph.D. student to predict short channel effects of an underlap core-shell junctionless transistor through the solution of Poisson’s equation in different region along with necessary conditions for continuity of potential and field. This approach has been able to predict the variation of electron concentration along the channel. For low-power applications, a combination of moderate doping with a wider core thickness in a core-shell topology was suggested over a high doping with narrow core thickness design for attaining reduced sensitivity of threshold voltage and suppressed short channel effects.",
        "The usefulness of junctionless transistor for use as a sensor through the detection of hydrogen gas by utilizing a gate-all-around nanowire topology was investigated through simulations and analytical model by an undergraduate student. The effects of temperature and pressure were considered in the transduction process through a change in gate workfunction of palladium gate after exposure to hydrogen gas which modified the subthreshold characteristics of the transistor. The performance of the transistor gas sensor was evaluated through off-current-based sensitivity as well as through threshold voltage sensitivity. The anomalous behavior of threshold voltage with temperature in the nanowire junctionless transistor under the influence of hydrogen gas was analyzed to focus on gas sensing at wider temperature range. Results showed that higher sensitivity values are achieved at lower temperatures due to an increase in the surface coverage of gas over the gate. The relatively simple topology of junctionless architecture with one type of dopant and being experimentally feasible in sub-100 nm regime makes it can attractive candidate for gas sensing applications with suitable gate material."

        "In incorporation of ferroelectric layer in gate stack can improve the performance of MOSFET through negative capacitance phenomenon. However, ferroelectric layer can also lead to hysteresis which is detrimental for logic applications. Research work of a Ph.D. student has resulted in defining device dependent conditions for achieving hysteresis-free sub-60 mV/decade (HF-sub-60) current transition in metal–ferroelectric–insulator–semiconductor (MFIS) nanowire transistor. Apart from MFIS, metal–ferroelectric–metal–insulator–semiconductor (MFMIS) topology can also be utilized for negative capacitance effect. An analytical model for cylindrical MFMIS transistor was developed by solving the baseline short channel nanowire model coupled with one-dimensional Landau’s equation. The analytical framework successfully captures the unconventional effects due to the ferroelectric layer in MFMIS cylindrical NW devices. Further, insights into subthreshold logic design using MFMIS transistor were investigated through an analytical model which was effective in predicting supply voltage dependent hysteresis as well as hysteresis-free voltage transfer characteristics.

The operation of reconfigurable transistor is governed by Schottky barrier, ungated regions as well as control and polarity gates. The inherent architecture of RFET, apart from lowering the effective drain bias, impedes the use of existing mobility extraction methodologies. In the research work carried out by M. Tech. student, a simple and effective methodology for determining resistive components i.e. resistance offered by various regions, effective drain bias across the un-gated transistor was proposed. The effective drain bias was shown to be function of the ratio of polarity gate resistive component to the total resistance. Further, the apparent low field mobility along with first and second order degradation coefficients were extracted for a reconfigurable transistor. The analytical expressions were able to accurately predict the variation of drain current and transconductance with control gate voltage of a reconfigurable for above threshold operation.",
        "Capacitorless dynamic memory operation in a reconfigurable field effect transistor is critically governed by different lengths associated with the three-gate architecture. These lengths consisting of ungated region (LUG), control gate (LCG), polarity gate (LPG), storage region length (LS), and total length (LT) can be sensitive to the fabrication process, and hence, critical for 1T-DRAM functionality. The research work of the PhD student presented an insightful critique of the above-mentioned lengths for realizing optimal 1T-DRAM. It was shown that a reconfigurable transistor with highest values of LS/LT and LCG/LT shows good short channel immunity but does not necessarily ensure enhanced 1T-DRAM metrics. Results also indicated that for a fixed LT, retention time can vary over a wide range (550 ms to 8.7 s) depending on the values of LS/LT and LCG/LT, and hence, appropriate optimization was imperative. The work contributed towards better understanding and optimizing LCG/LT to ensure improved 1T-DRAM metrics in terms of enhanced retention (> 64 ms), acceptable sense margin (> 6 μA/μm), current ratio (> 104) with low values of read (2 ns) and write (1 ns) time to further extend multi-functional facets of nanoscale reconfigurable transistor for memory applications. In addition, the effect of traps, process sensitivity, reduced number of voltage levels, and disturbance caused by shared word line (WL) or bit line (BL) were also analyzed. Results indicated that state ‘0’ of the cell sharing BL with the selected cell is strongly affected by BL disturbance. WL disturbance primarily impacts state ‘1’ of the cell sharing WL with selected cell (only for write 1 and read operations).",

Through subtle modifications (Fig. 19), without affecting current drive, capacitance and reconfigurable features, the research work of M.

Analysis based on device physics and operation, highlighted functionality towards standalone and embedded dynamic memory with impressive performance indicators: sense margin ~6 μA/μm, retention time >16 ms (for embedded), and >64 ms (for standalone) at 85 ~C, current ratio of ~104 along with a low write (~1 ns) and read (~2 ns) time.

        "Quantum confinement impacts the performance of a scaled down transistor through carrier quantization in sub-bands. Confinement can be considerable in junctionless transistor as the semiconductor film is heavily doped with scaled cross-section.

An ultralow-power subthreshold model for short-channel nanowire junctionless transistor with underlap was developed. Consistent values of subband energies were obtained for wide ranges of nanowire diameter and channel doping. The subband energy, electron line density, drain current, and threshold voltage of the transistor were determined and validated with simulations. DC figures of merit (voltage swing, switching threshold, voltage gain, and noise margin) of an ultralow-power subthreshold inverter were investigated using a simplified circuit model. It was shown that the noise margin can be considerably degraded when quantum effects are included in the analysis of scaled junctionless devices. The developed approach is of utmost benefit for device and circuit designers aiming for ultralow-power subthreshold logic technology."

The BS assigns the helper with a user depending on the cost and utility functions. After the assignment, the BS makes the payment to the helper confining to the fixed budget. Our aim is to maximize the utility of the BS and the total budget has to be constrained. Also, the matching strategy should be individually rational i.e., a helper when selected should be paid higher than its cost and truthful, there is no incentive for announcing a wrong cost i.e., the helpers are expected to report their true costs.

Specifically, considering the imperfect estimation and the time-variation of the fading channels, we formulate the three-phase ANC-based ORS strategy for the best relay among multiple relays in terms of both outdated and imperfect channel state information (CSI). With such a practical CSI modeling, we derive a tight lower bound expression for the overall system outage probability and an upper bound expression for the ergodic sum-rate of the considered scheme. In addition, by deriving an asymptotic outage behavior in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, we highlight the impact of outdated and imperfect CSI on the achievable diversity order. Moreover, based on the asymptotic analysis, we investigate three optimization problems, namely, optimal relay power allocation for fixed relay location, optimal relay location for fixed power allocation, and jointly optimal relay power allocation and location to minimize the overall outage probability and to maximize the ergodic sum-rate of the considered system. Our results reveal that the optimal relay power allocation has a more significant impact on the performance when the CSI is imperfect, whereas the optimal relay location has a more noticeable impact when the CSI is outdated and unbalanced over the two hops. Further, we show that the imperfect CSI can degrade the system performance more severely than the outdated CSI, and even it can reduce the system diversity order to zero.

        "The performance of a molecular signal detector relies on selected value of the detection threshold. In fact, arbitrary choice of detection threshold would increase either the probability of miss detection or the probability of false alarm. Thereby, an appropriate value of detection threshold is required in order to optimize the error performance of a realistic diffusion-based molecular communication (DbMC) system. For this, we come up with a new approach that yields optimal value for convex optimization problem in DbMC using logarithmic barrier followed by modified Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions, Newton Raphson method, and finally rounding the solution to the nearest integer value. Previous works on threshold optimization in DbMC either give suboptimal solution or optimal one whereof the convergence depends on choosing the smallest interval that contains the optimal value. Numerical and simulation results reveal that our proposed methodology can provide optimal solution with utmost accuracy in few iterations.",
        "In this work, we investigate the secrecy performance of multiple-input–multiple-output wiretap channels with outdated channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter. The joint effect of multiple jamming signals and noise at the eavesdropper is studied assuming that the transmitter adopts a transmit antenna selection technique, while both the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper use a maximal ratio combining scheme to achieve spatial diversity in reception. Exact closed-form expressions for the nonzero secrecy rate probability and the secrecy outage probability for an arbitrary number of power distributed jamming signals are derived, by assuming both perfect and imperfect CSI. The general secrecy outage probability expressions are simplified for 2 special cases, ie, different and equal power distributed interferers. Furthermore, we conduct an asymptotic secrecy outage analysis at high signal-to-noise ratio, which reveals that the expected diversity gain cannot be realized for imperfect CSI and full diversity order can only be achieved under the perfect CSI condition. In addition, our results reveal that the number of antennas at the eavesdropper as well as the number of jamming signals do not affect the system diversity order. Simulation results are performed to illustrate the effects of imperfect feedback and other key system parameters on the secrecy performance. Finally, our analytical results are validated through Monte Carlo simulations.",

For complexity-aware HSTSSS design, we propose an amplify-and-forward-based overlay spectrum sharing protocol using partial and opportunistic secondary network selection schemes. The secondary network selection aims to minimize the outage probability of the primary satellite system and, thereby, to explore spectrum sharing opportunities. With the overlay approach, the selected secondary network allocates part of its power to relay the satellite signal and utilizes the remaining power to transmit its own signal. Considering Shadowed-Rician fading for satellite links, and Nakagami-m as well as Rician fading for terrestrial links, we derive closed-form expressions for the outage probability of both primary and secondary networks, and examine their achievable diversity orders.

Herein, we employ transmit/receive beamforming at source nodes and analog network coding (ANC) at the relay node in the presence of CSI imperfections due to channel estimation errors (CEE) and feedback delay. With such a practical setup, we first deduce the pertinent instantaneous end-to-end signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) after performing partial self-interference cancellation. Then, by imposing asymmetric traffic requirements in two opposite directions, we conduct an accurate analysis of overall outage probability (OOP) of the considered system. We further derive a tight lower bound on OOP that has a simple and compact closed-form representation. Moreover, based on the asymptotic OOP expression at high SNR, we examine the achievable diversity order of the system. In addition, we acquire an upper bound expression of ergodic sum-rate (ESR) and simplify it further in useful compact form for high SNR regime. Besides, we investigate the optimization problems of relay position to minimize the OOP and to maximize the ESR.

In this scheme, a pair of D2D users facilitates relaying to the cellular nodes (base station and mobile user), and in return, they get the opportunity to exchange their own information by exploiting the same cellular spectrum. With this, the two end-to-end bidirectional communications (D2D and cellular) can be realized in three-time phases by using selection-combining technique at both cellular nodes and decode-and-forward (DF) relaying scheme at both participating D2D users. For DF operation, we consider two strategies, namely, exclusive-OR (XOR)-based DF, and superposition-based DF. All the channels are assumed to be time varying, and Markovian model is used to characterize the impact of nodes mobility. For this set-up, we first derive the outage probability for both cellular and D2D links under Rayleigh fading. Then, we obtain the asymptotic expressions of outage probability for both systems and used them further to reveal the critical value of power-splitting factor for spectrum sharing. Above all, we acquire the expression of average system throughput to perform a fair performance comparison with the other existing schemes",

Based on this estimate, we assess the performance of EF relaying in terms of molecular throughput and end-to-end error probability. Further, we calculate energy consumption in synthesizing the information molecules at the relay nanomachine. Thereafter, we optimize the detection threshold by solving the convex optimization problem using logarithmic barrier followed by modified Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, Newton Raphson method, and finally rounding the solution to the nearest integer value. Numerical and simulation results show the improvement in molecular throughput when EF relaying scheme is employed in contrast to the baseline direct communication scheme. The systematic comparisons reveal the scenarios where EF scheme can be beneficial over the existing amplify-and-forward and decodeand-forward relaying schemes.

By splitting up its available power, the SU assists in bidirectional primary transmissions and accesses the spectrum for its own transmission, based on satisfying the primary system outage constraint. Considering the involved N th-order statistics with correlation, we derive the outage probability expressions for both primary and secondary systems over general fading channels. Based on these expressions, we compute the total system throughput of the 3PCSS scheme and compare it with other competitive schemes.

Taking these imperfections into account, we derive a new closed-form expression for the outage probability of the considered CAFMRN employing selection cooperation over independent and non-identical Rayleigh fading channels. Furthermore, we derive an asymptotic outage behavior to assess achievable diversity order. We illustrate that HIs may invoke ceiling effects into the system, namely relay cooperation ceiling (RCC) and overall system ceiling (OSC). Specifically, we  showcase that the RCC ceases the full cooperation, whereas, the OSC may further aggravate the system outage performance under a high-rate requirement.

In the considered system, the battery-enabled relay node harvests energy from the ambient radio-frequency (RF) signals using a time switching approach. We demonstrate that HIs pose detrimental impact on the performance of system by invoking ceiling effects, primarily when high target rates are anticipated. Consequently, we propose an improved HDAF (IHDAF) relaying scheme which makes the efficient use of available degrees of freedom and thereby enhances the system performance significantly. As such, the IHDAF relaying may induce slightly higher complexity due to involvement of the limited feedback mechanism. However, the benefits offered by this scheme far outweigh its limitation.

Our algorithm is a generalized extension of the Gaussian filtering, which applies to any of the traditional Gaussian filters, such as the extended Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), and cubature Kalman filter (CKF). A further contribution is that we studied the stochastic stability of the proposed method for its EKF-based formulation. We compared the performance of the proposed filtering method with the traditional Gaussian filtering (particularly the CKF) and three extensions of the traditional Gaussian filtering that are designed to handle the delayed and missing measurements individually or simultaneously.",
        "Combining energy harvesting with cognitive radio and nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) techniques will be a notable candidate for improving both energy and spectral efficiency of wireless systems. In this work, we appraise the performance of an overlay cognitive NOMA (OCNOMA) system by employing an energy-harvesting-based spectrum sharing cooperation (SSC) scheme in the presence of hardware impairments (HIs) at the transceiver nodes. Herein, an energy-constrained secondary transmitter node harvests energy from primary transmitter’s radio-frequency signal and utilizes this energy to relay primary information signal as well as to transmit its own information signal using NOMA technique. For this, we investigate two SSC schemes using amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relaying strategies, named as SSC-AF and SSC-DF schemes. Importantly, we consider the impact of the imperfect successive interference cancellation in NOMA and distortion noises in signal processing due to HIs, which are inevitable in practical systems. Adopting Nakagami- m fading environments, we derive the expressions of outage probability for primary and secondary networks under both SSC-AF and SSC-DF schemes and, thereby, disclose some pertinent ceiling effects in the system. Furthermore, we evaluate the system throughput and energy efficiency for the considered OCNOMA system. Our results manifest the advantages of the proposed SSC schemes over the benchmark direct primary transmission and orthogonal multiple access schemes.",
        "Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) comprise a network of sensors subcutaneously implanted or placed near the body surface and facilitate continuous monitoring of health parameters of a patient. Research endeavours involving WBAN are directed towards effective transmission of detected parameters to a Local Processing Unit (LPU, usually a mobile device) and analysis of the parameters at the LPU or a back-end cloud. An important concern in WBAN is the lightweight nature of WBAN nodes and the need to conserve their energy. This is especially true for subcutaneously implanted nodes that cannot be recharged or regularly replaced. Work in energy conservation is mostly aimed at optimising the routing of signals to minimise energy expended. In this work, a simple yet innovative approach to energy conservation and detection of alarming health status is proposed. Energy conservation is ensured through a two-tier approach wherein the first tier eliminates “uninteresting” health parameter readings at the site of a sensing node and prevents these from being transmitted across the WBAN to the LPU. The second tier of assessment includes a proposed anomaly detection model at the LPU that is capable of identifying anomalies from streaming health parameter readings and indicates an adverse medical condition. In addition to being able to handle streaming data, the model works within the resource-constrained environments of an LPU and eliminates the need of transmitting the data to a back-end cloud, ensuring further energy savings. The anomaly detection capability of the model is validated using data available from the critical care units of hospitals and is shown to be superior to other anomaly detection techniques.",
        "Energy harvesting with cognitive radio and nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) techniques offer a promising solution to enhance the spectral and energy efficiency in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. This work investigates the performance of an overlay cognitive NOMA (OCNOMA) system tailored for IoT applications. Herein, the primary network includes a primary transmitter-receiver pair, whereas the secondary network comprises an energy-constrained full-duplex (FD) relaying-based secondary transmitter (ST) with its intended multiple receivers. Accordingly, ST employs a time-switching (TS)/power-splitting (PS)-based receiver architecture to harvest the energy from the radio-frequency signal of primary transmission and, thereby, uses this energy to relay the primary signal and to transmit its own signals simultaneously using the OCNOMA principle. For this, we propose a cooperative spectrum-sharing transmission (CSST) scheme using the decode-and-forward relaying strategy, while considering the realistic assumptions of FD-based loop self-interference, NOMA-based imperfect successive interference cancelation, and the transceiver hardware impairments in IoT devices. Adopting Nakagami-m fading environments, we comprehensively analyze the performance by deriving the expressions of the outage probability for the primary and secondary networks for the FD-based CSST scheme under both TS and PS protocols. Thereby, we disclose some apposite ceiling effects and provide an insight on deciding the value of the OCNOMA power allocation factor for efficacious spectrum-sharing cooperation. We further quantify throughput and energy efficiency for the overall system. Our results demonstrate the performance advantages of the proposed FD CSST scheme over the benchmark schemes and provide useful guidelines for the practical design of cognitive IoT networks.",
        "This work presents analysis of a molecular communication (MC) system considering time-dependent drift and diffusion of molecules. The proportionality in diffusion and drift is considered, and by applying the method of images, the general solution for Fokker-Planck (FP) equation is provided. Two different functional forms of the time-dependent drift and diffusion, viz., power-law time dependence and periodic driver, are used to analyze the MC system. The expressions for cumulative distribution function (CDF), also known as first passage probability (FPP), corresponding to first passage time density function (FPTDF) are derived. Moreover, the expressions for pulse-peak time and pulse peak of FPTDF are obtained. Further, the impacts of time-dependent drift and diffusion are examined in terms of average bit-error-rate (BER). Monte-Carlo and particle-based simulations (PBS) have also been performed to validate the feasibility of the used analytical models.",
        "The application of Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) technology into satellite-aerial-ground integrated networks can meet the requirements of ultra-high rate and massive connectivity for the Sixth Generation (6G) communication systems. We consider an uplink NOMA scenario for such a satellite-aerial-ground integrated network where multiple users communicate with satellite under the help of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) as an aerial relay equipped with a phased array. Supposing that buffer-aided decode-and-forward protocol is adopted at the UAV relay, we first formulate an optimization problem to maximize Ergodic Sum Rate (ESR) of the considered system subject to individual power constraint and quality-of-service constraint of each user. Then, with known imperfect channel state information of each user, we propose a joint power allocation and robust Beam Forming (BF) iterative algorithm to maximize ESR for the user-to-UAV link. Besides, to take the advantages of Free-Space Optical (FSO) and millimeter Wave (mmWave) communications, we present a switch-based hybrid FSO/mmWave scheme and a robust BF algorithm for the UAV-to-satellite link to achieve higher rate. Moreover, a closed-form ESR expression is derived. Finally, the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed solutions are verified by numerical simulations, and the performance evaluation results show that the proposed solutions not only achieve performance enhancement and robustness, but also outperform the orthogonal multiple access significantly.",

Herein, the nearby NOMA user works in full-duplex (FD) mode while employing a decode-and-forward relaying strategy for improving the performance of the far-away NOMA user. Importantly, we consider the realistic assumptions of FD-based loop self-interference and NOMA-based imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC). By exploiting the mutual interference and the pertinent hybrid channels, we analyze the performance of the secondary network in terms of outage probability (OP), ergodic sum rate, and throughput. Further, to perform a more comprehensive analysis, both perfect SIC (pSIC) and imperfect SIC (ipSIC) situations are taken into account for the FD mode and the benchmark half-duplex (HD) mode for comparison purposes. Also, we examine the asymptotic OP behaviour at a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to assess the achievable diversity orders. Our results manifest that FD C-NOMA outperforms HD C-NOMA for the case of ipSIC, whereas for the case of pSIC, HD C-NOMA can outperform FD C-NOMA in the high SNR regime.",

In this work, we derive the exact closed-form expressions for the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the maximal-ratio combining (MRC) of the FSO and RF links over the most generalized Malaga and 𝛼-𝜂-𝜅-𝜇 fading models. Further, with the help of derived MRC channel statistics (i.e. PDF and CDF), closed-form expressions for outage probability, average SER, and ergodic capacity for the hybrid FSO/RF system based on MRC and adaptive combining schemes are derived. In an adaptive combining scheme, the MRC of FSO and RF links is employed at the receiver, if the operating FSO link quality is unacceptable for transmission. Further, the derived expressions are unified for both intensity modulation/direct detection (IM/DD) and heterodyne detection (HD) techniques. We have considered the effects of atmospheric path loss, atmospheric turbulence induced fading and non-zero boresight pointing errors in case of the FSO link. We have also determined the optimum switching threshold and beam waist values for the adaptive combining scheme to achieve optimal performance. Moreover, computationally less complex asymptotic expressions are calculated and the diversity gains of MRC and adaptive combining schemes are determined. Finally, the performances of single link FSO, hard-switching-based hybrid FSO/RF, MRC, and adaptive-combining-based hybrid FSO/RF systems are compared and the inferences are reported under various turbulence conditions, link distances, weather conditions, and severity of the pointing errors.",
        "Unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV)-based communications are expected to play an important role in the future generation wireless communication networks. It is a promising solution to enhance the wireless connectivity of devices without infrastructure. As compared to the terrestrial communications, UAVs offer various advantages such as line-of-sight (LoS) connectivity, dynamic deployment and flexible reconfiguration. Further, FSO communication is considered as a possible solution to enable UAV-based communication links due to its cost effective and high bandwidth nature. However, despite offering large bandwidth, UAV-based FSO links are marred by atmospheric path loss, atmospheric turbulence, non-zero boresight pointing errors, and angle-of- arrival (AoA) fluctuations. In this work, the performance of a hovering UAV-based FSO communication system is investigated.

In addition, both the FSO and RF subsystems are assisted by intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS). Specifically, we carry out the performance analysis of the IRS-assisted hybrid FSO/RF system by deriving approximate closed-form expressions for outage probability, average bit error rate (BER), and ergodic channel capacity assuming IM/DD technique. The numerical results are shown along with insightful discussions. It is observed from the numerical results that the system performance improves as the number of elements in IRS increases. Further, the IRS-assisted hybrid FSO/RF system performs better in terms of ergodic capacity and average BER than the existing FSO and hybrid FSO/RF systems. Finally, Monte-Carlo simulations are presented to verify the correctness of the analytical results.

        "FSO communication due to its large optical carrier bandwidth offers better data rates close to gigabits per second (GBPS) compared to RF communication and can support seamless ubiquitous high-speed broadband connectivity, which is a significant requirement for sixth-generation (6G) communication. It is also envisioned that the data transmission in 6G communication will be over space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) to provide broadband global mobile connectivity. Thus, our main aim in this project is to investigate the performance of a dual-hop (DH) system model utilizing high-altitude platform station (HAPS) as a relay station with FSO communication for SAGIN scenario, which is expected to be featured in 6G communication. Despite various advantages, HAPS-based FSO satellite communication (SATCOM) is undermined by several factors such as atmospheric turbulence, pointing errors, and atmospheric attenuation. To improve the system performance in terms of capacity and reliability, hybrid FSO/RF communication with RF link as a backup is utilized between ground station (GS) and HAPS. The main contributions of our work are given as follows: Two novel switching schemes (i.e. hard-switching scheme and adaptive-combining-based switching scheme) have been proposed for HAPS-based hybrid FSO/RF communication such that the message signal can be transmitted via FSO or RF links or both. The unified closed-form expressions for performance metrics such as outage probability, average SER, ergodic capacity, and outage capacity are obtained for the DH SAGIN-based hybrid FSO/RF SATCOM system model. Comprehensive end-to-end performance analysis has been carried out assuming both Gamma-Gamma and generalized Malaga distributions for modelling atmospheric turbulence in FSO link with both zero and non-zero boresight pointing errors. In addition, the small-scale fading in RF link is modelled using Ricean, shadowed-Rician, and kappa-mu distributions. We derive the asymptotic expressions for outage probability, average SER, and ergodic capacity in closed-form and also obtain the diversity gain of the system. In addition, Monte Carlo simulations are used to verify the correctness of the derived analytical results. The closed-form expressions for optimum switching threshold SNR in case of hard-switching scheme, which minimizes average SER and maximizes ergodic capacity, are also obtained. Moreover, the optimal SNR values determined using the derived theoretical expressions are also verified using the numerical optimization technique. Finally, numerical optimization is carried out to determine optimum switching threshold in case of adaptive combining scheme. ",
        "We propose blind estimation algorithms to estimate the codeword length, code dimension, and generator polynomial of Bose-Chaudhuri- Hocquenghem (BCH) codes at the receiver over erroneous channel conditions assuming a non-cooperative scenario. The simulations are carried out on many test cases to validate the proposed blind estimation algorithms and the results are given to testify the algorithms. We infer that the probability of correct estimation of parameters increases with decrease in codeword length. Finally, it is also inferred that the proposed algorithm performs better than the existing algorithms reported in the literature.  Novel blind estimation algorithms are proposed to estimate the codeword length of low-density parity check (LDPC) codes at the receiver considering non-cooperative scenario and assuming the availability of only limited amount of data. Simulations have been performed to validate the proposed blind estimation algorithms over erroneous channel conditions. The simulation results and accuracy of estimation plots are shown for various test cases to testify our algorithms. It is observed that the performance of the proposed algorithms in terms of data usage is better than the existing algorithm available in the literature. It is also inferred that the probability of correct estimation increases with increase in number of codewords available at the receiver Novel algorithms for the blind recognition of codeword length and code dimension of polar codes are proposed considering erroneous or noisy environment. Algorithm 1 was proposed based on peak-finding approach to estimate codeword length and Algorithm 2 was proposed based on clustering approach to estimate code dimension. It is also observed that both the algorithms perform with higher accuracy of estimation of code parameters as compared to the existing rank-ratio-based algorithm in the literature. ",
        "Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a key technique for 5G and beyond wireless communications, as its spectral efficiency is better than conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) techniques. A cooperative NOMA system model with partial relay selection (PRS) scheme is proposed, where the base station (BS) sends the message signal to the mobile users with the help of multiple decode-and-forward (DF) relays. Here, the selection combining technique is employed by mobile users to combine the direct and relay transmissions for improving the reliability. In addition, we also investigate the performance of the proposed system model as well as impact of the number of relays on the system performance through outage probability, ergodic capacity, and overall system throughput considering the Rayleigh fading channel. Further, the obtained expressions for the performance metrics are validated using Monte-Carlo simulation results. Recently, RF energy harvesting (EH) technique is applied in cooperative communication systems for 5G and beyond wireless communications. To exploit the benefits, we investigate the performance of a simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)- enabled cooperative NOMA system with DF relaying technique. We consider a scenario, where BS communicates with two users with the help of one EH relay, which is selected out of multiple relays using PRS scheme. The selected relay harvests energy through RF signals received from BS using a time-switching-based relaying (TSR) EH protocol. Furthermore, the relay utilizes the harvested energy from BS to forward the decoded information to the mobile users. The performance of the proposed system model is analyzed by deriving closed-form expressions for outage probability, ergodic capacity, energy efficiency, and overall system throughput over Rayleigh fading channels. Since perfect channel state information (CSI) and successive interference cancellation (SIC) are not practically possible at the receiver nodes in the proposed system model, we have also considered the effects of imperfect CSI and SIC on the system performance. Finally, Monte-Carlo simulations are presented to verify the correctness of the analytical expressions."

        "Product codes are multidimensional codes constructed using multiple component codes. Turbo convolutional codes (TCC) is a parallel concatenation of multiple convolutional codes. Both the forward error correction (FEC) codes play a vital role in improving the performance of modern digital/wireless communication and storage systems. In the existing communication systems, the code parameters are known at the receiver. However, in a non-cooperative scenario, which exists in military and spectrum surveillance systems, the FEC code parameters are not known at the receiver. Hence, it is essential to blindly estimate the code parameters for decoding the message symbols. In our recent works, novel algorithms over noisy channel conditions are proposed for the blind estimation of TCC and two-dimensional product code parameters considering Reed-Solomon (RS) and Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) as component codes. The performance of the algorithms in terms of probability of correct estimation is investigated for different code and modulation parameters. It is observed that the accuracy improves with decrease in modulation order (M), code dimension, and constraint length (K) values ",
        "Free space optics (FSO) communication refers to a line of sight communication between two fixed points in the atmosphere using optical carriers. FSO communication has garnered significant importance to provide gigabit capacity links owing to its unique features: cheap installation cost with faster deployment, unlicensed spectrum, highly secure system due to line-of-sight operation, narrow laser beam enabling numerous FSO links, relatively high bandwidth, and low power usage per bit transmission. FSO communication over near infrared (IR) band is a good candidate to establish either terrestrial links within the Earth’s atmosphere or inter-satellite links or ground-to-satellite/satellite-to-ground links. However, despite of many advantages, FSO supports high data rate for only short-range transmission and the performance of FSO communication is limited by the adverse effects of the atmospheric turbulence induced fading, attenuation due to fog, and pointing or misalignment errors, which is due to beam wander and building sway. Therefore, to improve the performance of FSO links, it is wise to backup with reliable radio frequency (RF) links. Meanwhile, FSO and RF channels exhibit complementary characteristics to fog and rain. Therefore, these two complementary characteristics pave the way for hybrid FSO/RF communication, which provides reliable high data rate transmission. This project is designed with the visionary view that the fusion of these two exciting technologies is inevitable for future terrestrial communication systems. The research works that are carried out are highlighted in the following points. Simple switching scheme to switch between FSO and RF sub-systems has been proposed for decode-and-forward (DF) relay-based hybrid FSO/RF terrestrial communication system by considering only atmospheric turbulence and atmospheric attenuation in case of FSO communication. The performance analysis has been carried out by deriving exact and asymptotic symbol error rate (SER) and outage probability expressions. The performance analysis of the aforementioned system has been investigated by considering atmospheric turbulence and atmospheric attenuation along with pointing errors in case of FSO communication. In addition, the usage of RF backup links in improving the system performance by counteracting pointing errors has been reported for different weather, turbulence conditions, and link distance. The capacity analysis of the hybrid FSO/RF terrestrial communication system has also been carried out by deriving exact and asymptotic capacity expressions. In a nutshell, it has been observed that the hybrid FSO/RF system with RF backup links improves the reliability of FSO communication to a larger extent by compromising on the overall average capacity in the low-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region to a smaller extent."

        "Effective feature representation of signals plays an important role in several signal analysis tasks. Specifically, feature representation of physiological signals such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) is an integral part of automated diagnosis systems. The major steps involved in a signal classification approach are feature representation and classification. The purpose of feature representation is to obtain discriminative information from the signals, while the classifier employs these feature vectors to identify the signals' category. The performance of a signal classification approach depends on both the features and the classifier. In this work, the focus was on developing effective feature representation techniques. Specifically, we developed a set of novel one-dimensional (1D) local descriptor-based features for signal classification. The name' local descriptor' reflects the operator's functionality, i.e., the features are computed by performing statistical or logical operations in a sample's predefined local neighborhood.",

        "Large-scale deployment of biometric systems in a wide range of applications necessitates reliable biometric performance and the security of the deployed biometric systems against potential attacks. The presentation attack, which involves presenting a fake copy (artefact) of the real biometric sample to the biometric sensor, is the most common. This is because of its high success rate and ease with which it can be carried out compared to other attacks requiring a higher degree of effort on the attacker’s part. In this work, we assessed the vulnerability of palmprint verification systems to presentation attacks using print and display artefacts and developed an image statistics-based PAD technique to secure the palmprint verification systems. We analyzed the susceptibility of a dorsal hand-vein biometric system to smartphone camera-based display attacks and developed a PAD approach to address their vulnerability using multiscale histogram of oriented gradient features. We also developed a PAD approach to secure a palm-vein biometric system using features extracted from noise-residual images",

In this work, we explored CNN-based approaches for gender recognition using near-infrared images of the periocular region. Our system automatically detects, and extracts left and right periocular areas in the first stage. The first approach utilizes a domain-specific pre-trained CNN to extract deep features from the periocular images. A trained support vector machine (SVM) then uses these features to predict the gender information. The second approach employs an end-to-end classifier obtained by fine-tuning a pre-trained CNN on the periocular images. The LBP and histogram of oriented gradient-based methods have been used as baseline methods to ascertain the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The results indicate that our methods achieve higher classification accuracy than the baseline methods, particularly on one public database containing a large number of non-ideal images. In addition, the accuracy of the proposed approaches is consistently higher than the existing eyebrow feature-based method."

We instigated the efficacy of pore-based features for high-resolution fingerprint indexing, especially for partial fingerprints, which may not contain a sufficient number of level-1 and level-2 features. We developed learning-based approaches for detecting pores and additional level-3 features, namely, dots and incipient ridges. Our model generates a pore intensity map, which is processed using a maxima filter to obtain pore coordinates. We developed a CNN model for pore-based biometric recognition that learns distinctive representation from patches around the detected pores. The descriptors generated from these patches are used to match fingerprints. We investigated the domain adaptability of the existing learning-based pore detection approaches on cross-sensor fingerprint images for the first time. Using an unsupervised domain adaptation technique, a learning-based pore detection approach is developed to detect pores in cross-sensor scenarios."

        "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have dominated the field of computer vision for nearly a decade due to their strong ability to learn local features. However, due to their limited receptive field, CNNs fail to model the global context. On the other hand, a transformer employing an attention-based architecture can model the global context easily. Most of the existing crowd-counting methods are based on the regression of density maps, which requires point-level annotation of each person in the scene. This annotation task is laborious and error prone. This has led to an increased focus on weekly-supervised crowd-counting methods, which require only count-level annotations. In this work, we developed a weakly-supervised method for crowd counting using a pyramid vision transformer. Our approach is comparable to the state-of-the-art on benchmark crowd datasets. More importantly, it shows remarkable generalizability.",
        "High-resolution fingerprint recognition is mainly centered around local descriptors created using pore patches. Although these methods provide good verification performance, they are not well-suited for identification due to poor computational performance and variable and large template size caused by the varying number of useful pore patches. We developed a deep learning model that overcomes this problem by learning to generate a fixed-sized global descriptor while considering the finer level-3 features by infusing domain knowledge using a multitasking architecture. Our approach employs a CNN with two branches simultaneously trained to generate descriptors and pore-intensity maps. Our method compares favorably to the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy while being significantly faster (∼ 24× for verification and ∼ 518000× for identification) and having a smaller template size."

        "The primary objective of this work was to analyze all sorts of time-varying disturbances including interharmonics in real-time while maintaining maximum possible accuracy. Another objective includes the development of a novel online automatic recognition approach for accurate classification of single and combined disturbances under noisy conditions. To fulfill these objectives, adaptive and intelligent techniques based on The Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT) and Tunable-Q Wavelet Transform (TQWT)  were developed. These two adaptive signal processing techniques were customized for analyzing all sorts of PQ disturbances. Adaptive techniques based on the EWT were developed for precise estimation of signal parameters and PQ indices of distorted time-varying signals. The main emphasis was to extract the actual fundamental frequency component, which can reflect the voltage disturbances correctly. The results of synthetic and practical signals justified the feasibility and advantages of these techniques. Further, two new classification models were proposed based on the Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification of single and combined disturbances utilizing only six basic features. In the first classification model, a multiclass SVM was built employing only nine binary SVMs, each dedicated for detection of a single disturbance. The second classification method categorizes the PQ disturbances into two based on the signal information and employed a dual multiclass SVM. It is a known fact that a linear classifier with basic features is adequate to identify the single PQ disturbances if the extracted fundamental frequency component is accurate. Therefore, the TQWT was utilized to tune the wavelet filters for extraction of the actual fundamental frequency component. Extensive testing on simulated and real disturbance signals revealed that both the proposed classifiers have an overall classification accuracy of around 97% with the mean classification time of at most 80 ms. Finally, the hardware implementation of the EWT-based PQ indices was performed on the TMS320F28377S DSP. Investigation on real signals confirmed the practicality of the approach for online estimation of PQ indices with the maximum possible accuracy."

Various types of passive loads include resistive (R) load, inductive (RL) load and constant power load (CPL). In this work, a generalized model of IIMGs feeding R load, RL load, CPL, RIAL and dynamic IM load has been developed. The developed model was used to investigate the impact of load dynamics as well as load sharing among IIDG units on the stability and dynamic performance of IIMGs. Based on these investigations, decentralized, centralized and two-level hierarchical controllers were developed. The proposed controllers were designed based on a robust extended Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control, which combines the Kalman estimator with the Linear Quadratic Regulator with Prescribed Degree of Stability (LQRPDS). In order to obtain the optimal values of the diagonal weighting matrices of Kalman estimator and LQRPDS, a bi-objective optimization problem was formulated and solved using a fast and elitist multi-objective Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II). The proposed controllers produce supplementary control signals to the local power sharing controller of each IIDG unit and DC voltage as well as AC current controllers of the RIAL. Eigenvalue analysis and time-domain simulations were performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed controllers. The proposed controllers provide robust control performance under various load configurations as well as small load disturbances.

        "This work utilized synchronized measurements for developing an improved monitoring and assessment scheme for power system security using intelligent classifiers. To achieve this, a new framework for Static Security Assessment (SSA) and Transient Security Assessment (TSA) was developed. The proposed framework for SSA consists of four classifiers, where classifier I is used to predict the static security status of the system as secure or insecure for a particular loading condition and classifier II determines the type of violations (either line overload/bus voltage violation or both) that causes insecurity in the power system. Classifier III is used to predict the security status of that particular loading condition with respect to all probable N-1 contingencies. Similarly, classifier IV predicts the type of violations causing insecurity in those insecure patterns identified by classifier III. The inputs to these classifiers are the synchronized measurements viz. bus voltage phasors, branch real and reactive power flows measured by PMUs. Some of the intelligent classifiers which have been utilized for this assessment include Wavelet Support Vector Machine (WSVM), Case Based Reasoning (CBR) and AdaBoost algorithm. These classifiers are found to have better generalization capability than the traditional classifiers used for security assessment. Simulation results obtained using WSVM, CBR and AdaBoost classifiers are compared with the results obtained using existing techniques. For TSA, the measured rotor angles of the generators are used as inputs to the proposed classifier models. This TSA framework consists of three classifier models in which classifier I determines the transient security status and classifier II is used to determine the generator coherency. Classifier III is a hybrid classifier, which determines the individual generator synchronism state for a given operating condition. This hybrid classifier consists of an array of parallel classifiers, where one classifier is assigned to each generating unit of the power system. Finally, the proposed approach was implemented and tested on standard benchmark systems such as IEEE 14-bus, IEEE 30-bus and on a practical Indian 246-bus networks. Simulation results revealed that the proposed method can enhance the overall monitoring and assessment of power system with the use of synchronized measurements and with classifiers having high generalization capability.",
        "The objective of this work was to assess the grid level charging/discharging impacts and propose models to exploit the storage potential of the batteries of an aggregation of a large number of light-duty EVs, primarily the electric cars, for grid support services. To achieve this, the charging load curves of EVs were developed based on mobility attributes and charging protocols. In transportation, the average car is parked almost 95% of the time leaving enormous time margin during the day to exploit the storage potential of the battery for grid support services. This led the researchers to propose the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) mode of operation of EVs in which a proportion of energy stored in the battery (after accounting for driving consumption) can be injected back into the grid at the peaking periods. Based on this, the V2G energy profiles were realized with various discharge power levels for a defined mobility pattern. The V2G support is not only dependent on the number of vehicles available to support the grid but is also dependent on the heterogeneity of the aggregation where Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) may contribute more to V2G than Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV). The heterogeneity in the vehicles as well as in the mobility behavior is further incorporated to determine the Grid-to-Vehicle (G2V) and V2G power capabilities of the aggregation at different moments of parking under varying penetrations of the electric vehicles. The quantification of the effects of the simultaneous combination of resulting G2V and V2G profiles with the conventional load on hourly loading and electricity market price was studied taking IEEE Test Bus system as an example. The coordinated grid connection of EV aggregation can also be employed to provide short- term ancillary services like regulation, thereby increasing the power system reliability and side by side forming a revenue stream for the grid-connected vehicles for the contracts made in the competitive services market. To test this, a simulative model for minute wise power scheduling during the charging and discharging phases is developed to obtain the MW capacity through a large pool of vehicles which can be contracted as the regulation capacity commitment in the ancillary services market. Considering the aspect of vehicles of changeable locations, two operational places, the workplace, and the home was selected as per the driving practices to simulate the V2G and G2V activities.

Hence, to prevent such unwanted occurrences, it is essential to identify these oscillations at the earliest. As the characteristics of these oscillations are not similar, different algorithms are needed for the proper analysis of these oscillating modes. Algorithms based on Hankel’s Total Least Square (HTLS) and Estimation of Signal Parameters using Rotational Invariance Technique (ESPRIT) were developed for analysing ringdown oscillations. The model order which is a prerequisite for the proper implementation of HTLS and ESPRIT algorithms, were obtained through an FFT based technique and EMO algorithm respectively. A Stochastic Subspace Identification (SSI) based method was developed to analyse ambient type of oscillations. To improve the robustness of the proposed SSI based method, a Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) based denoising method was used.

        "The growth of CIGS thin films on soda-lime glass substrates at different substrate temperatures by dual ion beam sputtering system in a single-step route from a single quaternary sputtering target with the composition of Cu (In0.70 Ga0.30) Se2 was reported. The effects of the substrate temperature on structural, optical, morphological and electrical properties of CIGS films were investigated. Stoichiometry of one such film was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. All CIGS films had demonstrated a strong (112) orientation located at 2θ 26.70o, which indicated the chalcopyrite structure of films. The value of full-width at half-maximum of (112) peak was reduced from 0.58° to 0.19° and crystallite size was enlarged from 14.98 to 43.05 nm as growth temperature was increased from 100 to 400 °C. However, atomic force microscope results showed a smooth and uniform surface at lower growth temperature and the surface roughness was observed to increase with increasing growth temperature. Hall measurements exhibited the minimum film resistivity of 0.09 Ω cm with a hole concentration of 2.42 × 1018 cm−3 and mobility of 28.60 cm2 V−1 s−1 for CIGS film grown at 100 °C. Film absorption coefficient was found to enhance nominally from 1 × 105 to 2.3 × 105 cm−1 with increasing growth temperature from 100 to 400 °C.",
        "CdZnO thin films with a nominal thickness of ~200 nm were grown on c-plane sapphire substrates by dual ion-beam sputtering deposition technique. The effect of substrate temperature (300–600 °C) and gas ambience on structural, morphological, compositional and opto-electronic properties was studied. X-ray diffraction patterns confirmed that all the films were polycrystalline in nature and were preferentially oriented along the c-axis. It was revealed that the films grown at Ar/O2 ratio of 4:1 were structurally more ordered and the film quality was found to be the best at 500 °C. The compositional studies specify that approximately 11.8 at.% of cadmium were present in the film deposited at 300 °C in Ar–O2 mixture. Investigations on optical properties by photoluminescence and absorption studies indicate band gap shrinkage with the increase in argon partial pressure and substrate temperature. It was found that photosensitivity of the deposited films was highly dependent on growth conditions. The photosensitivity was found to be 5000-fold higher for CdZnO film grown at 600 °C in Ar–O2 ambience compared to the best reported result, and this was promising to realize high-performance opto-electronic devices on such CdZnO films.",

The diode yielded blue electroluminescence emissions at around 446 nm in forward biased condition at room temperature. The emission intensity increased with the increase of the injection current. A red shifting of the emission peak position was observed with the increment of ambient temperature, indicating a change of band gap of the CdZnO active layer with temperature in low-temperature measurement."

The dielectric functions have been obtained from ellipsometry data analyses using Cody-Lorentz oscillator in the GenOsc model. A gradual reduction in the value of electron concentration and finally the conversion of doping characteristics from donor type to acceptor type was observed with the rise in Tg. This, in turn, resulted in the decline of broadening of ɛ1 peaks, and hence in the increase of excitonic lifetime. Optical band-gap energy was observed to decrease with increase in Tg from 200 to 300 °C, and then rise continuously with further increase in Tg. X-ray diffraction measurements showed that all SZO films had (002) preferred crystal orientation. Hall measurement and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis confirmed that the change in the electrical conduction from n-to p-type was due to the enhancement in the value of Sb5+/Sb3+ ratio and SbZn–2VZn complex formation in SZO films.",

The unbiased photodetection is attributed to the tunnelling of electrons due to heavy doping of GZO and built-in electric field due to different barriers at the two metal semiconductor contacts.

Detailed study of the effects of alloy composition, dopant concentration, and thickness of the electron blocking layer (EBL) and hole blocking layer (HBL) on the IQE is carried out. The optimization in selecting materials for EBL, HBL, and active layer is addressed while maximizing device IQE and reducing the efficiency droop. The impact of Auger non-radiative recombination on luminous power and quantum efficiency is discussed. The mechanisms behind efficiency droop, namely Auger recombination and electron leakage are elaborated. It is found that the hybrid LED shows the highest IQE of 93% with minimum efficiency droop as compared to ZnO based and GaN based LEDs for similar design parameters."

The crystal structure of all CZTSSe films are identified to be preferentially (112)-oriented, polycrystalline in nature, and without the existence of secondary phases such as Cu2(S, Se) or Zn(S, Se). The full-width at half-maximum of (112) diffraction peak is the minimum with a value of 0.12° and the maximum crystallite size 75.11 nm for CZTSSe grown at 300 °C. Morphological investigation reveals the achievement of the largest grain size at Tsub = 300 °C.

        "The electrical characteristics of Au/MgZnO:Ga (GMZO) Schottky contact, which is fabricated using a dual ion beam sputtering system, have been investigated using current–voltage (I–V) and capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements over a wide temperature range of 80 to 300 K. The apparent Schottky barrier height (SBH) and ideality factor obtained from the I–V measurements are observed to increase and reduce, respectively, with increasing measurement temperature. This anomalous observation in the behaviour of the SBH is in good agreement with the predictions of a double Gaussian distribution (DGD) of the inhomogeneous SBH at a metal–semiconductor (MS) interface. The values of the SBH as determined from C–V measurements are expectedly higher than those extracted from I–V measurements. The DGD model is observed to fit with experimentally obtained data for the temperature-dependent SBH with mean values of the SBH of 0.95 and 0.54 eV and standard deviations of 0.131 and 0.072 eV in the temperature range of 160–300 K and 80–160 K, respectively. The larger value of the SBH standard deviation confirms more SBH inhomogeneity at the MS interface, and these inhomogeneities are attributed to the presence of deep level or surface level interface states. The calculated interface states density is seen to vary from 6.46  ×  1014 eV−1 cm−2 at EC-0.27 eV to 1.58  ×  1014 eV−1 cm−2 at EC-0.74 eV, where EC is the bottom of a conduction band at 300 K.",
        "The crystalline, electrical, morphological, optical properties and plasmonic behaviour of Ga doped MgZnO (GMZO) thin films grown at different substrate temperatures (200–600 °C) by a dual ion beam sputtering (DIBS) system are investigated. Transmittance value of more than 94% in 400–1000 nm region is observed for all GMZO films. The particle plasmon features can be detected in the absorption coefficient spectra of GMZO grown at 500 and 600 °C in the form of a peak at 4.37 eV, which corresponds to a plasmon resonance peak of nanoclusters formed in GMZO. The presence of such plasmonic features is confirmed by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. The values of particle plasmon resonance energy of various nanoclusters are in the range of solar spectrum, and these can easily be tuned and excited at the desirable wavelengths while optimizing the efficiency of solar cells (SCs) by simple alteration of DIBS growth temperature. These nanoclusters are extremely promising to enhance the optical scattering and trapping of the incident light, which increases the optical path length in the absorber layer of cost-effective SCs and eventually increases its efficiency."

While surface donor states are reported to govern the formation of 2DEG in epitaxially grown heterostructures, our simulations suggest a non-negligible contribution of surface acceptor states in the 2DEG density. In addition, the existence of interface charges due to high defect density along with appropriate values of donor and acceptor states is essential to accurately predict an order of magnitude higher 2DEG density grown by sputtering. This paper analyzes the distinct roles of donor and acceptor states along with interface charges in 2DEG formation and achieved values.",

Here, we report a novel method to generate wide-band sputter-stimulated plasmonic feature in Ga-doped-MgZnO (GMZO) thin-films, which are observed due to the different metallic and metal-oxide nanoclusters formation. Through an extensive analysis of photoelectron spectroscopy, spectroscopic ellipsometry, and field-emission scanning electron microscope measurements the evaluation of plasmonic features and correlation of them with various nanoclusters inside GMZO thin-film is performed. Additionally, the suitability and expected performance of plasmon-enhanced GMZO thin-film based buffer-less SCs are probed through; 1) band-offset analysis at the plasmon enhanced-GMZO/CIGSe heterojunction; 2) simulation studies to analyze the effect of conduction band-offset (CBO) on the performance of the buffer-less SCs; 3) predicting the performance of the buffer-less SC using the parameters of GMZO thin-films with varying CBO, and 4) envisaging the concept of ultrathin buffer-less SC with calculated CBO and absorber layer thickness (300 nm) for ultrathin SCs.

        "This research discusses several aspects of current conduction mechanism for resistive switching (RS) of a reactive electrode-based memristor (Al/ZnO/Al) against generally used inert electrode–based devices has been illustrated. Compliance current (Icc), i.e. maximum current through device and stop voltage (Vstop), i.e. maximum Vstop upon device, has been used as bias characteristics to evaluate the effect upon conduction behavior. Effect of change in Icc for constant Vstop and vice-versa upon high resistance state (HRS) and low resistance state (LRS) has been evaluated in terms of change in bulk defects, i.e. oxygen vacancy and interface inhomogenity, i.e. AlOx formation/dissolution. The device shows unipolar resistive switching (URS) at lower Icc (< = 0.1 mA) and transits irreversibly into bipolar resistive switching (BRS) at higher Icc (> = 1 mA). The dominant conduction behavior of the device is found to be homogenous resistive switching (HoRS). The conduction in HRS and LRS is found to be space-charge limited current conduction. Conductive atomic force microscopy results of the thin film switching layer support the HoRS mechanism and also illustrate the role of interfacial oxide in attributing BRS behavior in the Al/ZnO/Al resistive switch. Studies can be utilized in future to further understand the RS conduction mechanism in reactive electrode–based RS and can be applied for multi-state memory applications."

        "A chemiresistive carbon monoxide (CO) gas sensor comprising of an organo-di-benzoic acidified zinc oxide (ODBA-ZnO) nanohybrid material is reported. The ODBA-ZnO hybrid material is prepared via a single-pot hydrothermal method. The electrical resistance of the drop-casted ODBA-ZnO film on interdigitated electrodes increases noticeably upon exposure to CO (5–500 ppm). The resistance increase is attributed to the formation of complex ions at the organic (ODBA)–inorganic (ZnO) interface in the presence of CO. The detailed CO sensing properties of the ODBA-ZnO nanohybrids reveal a remarkable selectivity to CO gas in comparison to other gases like CO2, H2S, and NH3 at 125 °C. The maximum response to 100 ppm of CO is observed to be 35% with the achieved selectivity to CO being 88%, which is the best reported CO selectivity result available in the literature to date. The ODBA-ZnO nanohybrid sensor takes nearly 91 s to reach the saturated response to 100 ppm of CO and nearly 175 s to recover from it in a synthetic air environment. A systematic study using field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, nitrogen adsorption–desorption tests, and thermogravimetric analysis reveals that introduction of an organic moiety (ODBA) to ZnO played a key role in achieving improved selectivity and sensitivity toward CO. The present work provides a simple route for fabricating the ODBA-ZnO sensor to achieve better selectivity and sensitivity to CO gas at a relatively low temperature (125 °C)."

        "This work emphasis the synthesis of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides via the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) system. Synthesis of a uniform and large-sized monolayer MoS2 atomic thin film via CVD is still a major bottleneck owing to strong dependence on diverse associated growth parameters. In this work, we have proposed the most viable recipe which is suitable for controlling the nucleation density of Mo and producing a 90 μm-long MoS2 monolayer crystal and (695 × 394.8) μm2 large MoS2 monolayered film on SiO2/Si and c-plane sapphire, respectively. Moreover, MoS2 monolayer sensing performance has been thoroughly investigated for NO2 exposure at room temperature with a varying response of 4–57.5 for the 100–100 ppm level. Furthermore, the MoS2 monolayer sensor exhibits an ultrasensitive NO2 detection with limit of detection and limit of qualification values of 1.4 and 4.6 ppb, respectively. In addition, the first-principles-based density functional theory has been employed to analyze the adsorption of NO2 on the surfaces of the 2D MoS2 monolayer. It is observed that the electronic band gap of the MoS2 monolayer after NO2 adsorption is reduced by 0.7 eV due to molecular orbital hybridization.",
        "Here, we report the electrical performance analysis of a Y2O3 -based memristive crossbar array (MCA) of ( 30×25 ) on a large Si (100) wafer having a 3-inch diameter by utilizing dual-ion beam sputtering (DIBS) system. The MCA is highly stable and exhibits repeatable and reproducible resistive switching responses in terms of consistent resistive switching voltages ( VSET and VRESET ). The devices in the MCA efficiently depict the impact of device area scaling on the switching voltage parameters. The fabricated devices also show low device-to-device (D2D) variability in VSET (2.64%) VRESET (10.13%) and ultralow cycle-to-cycle (C2C) variability in VSET (0.2%) and VRESET (1.07%). Furthermore, this work also experimentally probes the impacts of various input signal parameters such as applied voltage, compliance current, and pulsewidth (PW) on the variability parameters.",
        "This work presents the influence of substrate temperature ( Tsub ) and post-sulfurization on compositional, structural, electrical, and optical properties of dual-ion beam sputtering (DIBS)-grown Cu2(Sn,Ge)(S,Se)3 (CTGSSe) thin films grown on a soda-lime glass (SLG) substrate using a single target. Post-sulfurization of CTGSSe thin films is carried out in a quartz tube chemical vapor deposition (CVD) system. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis reveals that the crystal structure of CTGSSe thin films is preferentially tetragonal with (112) and (204) lattice planes at 2θ values of 27.3° and 47.3°, respectively. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has emphasized that the high Tsub growth resulted in a larger grain size of 87 nm and better thin-film morphology. Spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) analysis shows the bandgap values of 1.46–1.62 eV by varying Tsub from room temperature (RT) to 300 °C. Furthermore, the bandgap widens from 1.56 to 1.64 eV in the CTGSSe thin films due to post-sulfurization."

        "In this project work, we reported the fabrication of enzymatic glucose biosensor based on the growth of high-density polypyrrole (PPy) nanoﬁber network using one step template free electropolymerization method. PPy was grown potentiostatically on Gold-coated glass substrates. Signiﬁcant changes in the sensing response were observed for biosensors fabricated with different concentrations of pyrrole (Py) monomer and polymerization potentials. Among the fabricated biosensors, the highest sensitivity of 1.9 mA/cm2/M, with a wide range of linear operation (125 µM–11.25 mM), was observed for 0.15 M Py concentration and 0.8 V polymerization potential. The observed results indicate that low monomer concentration and moderately low polymerization potential is highly suitable for growth of PPy nanoﬁber network with controllable ﬁber diameters having high aspect ratio, resulting in high sensitivity for biosensor application.",
        "In this paper, a performance-based comparison of top and bottom contact organic thin ﬁlm transistor (OTFT) device structures, using two-dimensional numerical simulations, has been carried out. In addition to this, investigations pertaining to the estimation of contact resistance in these OTFTs were also performed. To estimate contact resistance, the conventional transmission line method and modiﬁed transmission line method (M-TLM) were respectively invoked. Our simulation results clearly indicate that the latter is more accurate in the estimation of contact resistance compared to the conventional method. Furthermore, the MTLM was used to estimate the gate voltage and ﬁlm thickness dependence of the contact resistance for the two device structures. The observed results have been explained based on the signiﬁcantly lowered area of carrier injection and extraction regions, at the source/channel and channel/drain interface respectively, in bottom contact transistor that leads to its inferior performance over the top contact transistor."

The FTM OPT shows 2-order-higher photosensitivity under an electrically induced off-state as compared with the SC OPT. Furthermore, the FTM OPT shows improved gate voltage tunability of photosensitivity and responsivity as compared with the SC OPT. These observed results are explained based on the improved thin film morphology of the active poly (3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) layer in the FTM OPT, pointing towards the significance of thin film processing conditions in obtaining high-sensitivity OPTs. This was a first of its kind of report in the literature for employing FTM to develop a polymer-based photosensitive OFET.",

In order to optimize the polymerization time, immobilization of glucose oxidase (GOx) was ﬁrst performed using physical adsorption followed by measuring its biosensing response which was examined amperometrically for increasing concentrations of glucose. In order to further improve the sensing performance of the biosensor fabricated for optimum polymerization duration, enzyme immobilization was carried out using cross-linking with glutaraldehyde and bovine serum albumin (BSA). Approximately sixfold enhancement in the sensitivity was observed in the fabricated electrodes. The biosensors also showed a wide range of linear operation (0.2–13 mM), limit of detection of 50 µM glucose concentration, excellent selectivity for glucose, notable reliability for real sample detection and substantially improved shelf life."

Among different biosensors fabricated having varied aspect ratio and surface defect density of ZNA, the best electrode resulted into sensitivity and response time to be 18.7 mA cm−2M−1 and <5 s respectively.

The UV emission in metal-coated ZnO nanorods was increased compared to the pristine ZnO. In this report, we proposed a new mechanism incorporating the non-radiative decay of surface plasmons to hot electrons and hot holes (generated through d-sp interband transitions). KM absorption spectra have confirmed the interband transitions at nearly 1.5 eV for Al and 2.4 eV for Au.

Chromium coated ZnO nanorods showed the suppression of deep level emissions by more than twenty-five times compared to pristine ZnO nanorods, which was attributed to the Schottky contacts between Cr and ZnO resulting in defect passivation, weak exciton-plasmon coupling, enhanced electric field effect and formation of hot carriers due to interband transitions. Further, a planar photodetector was fabricated (Ag–ZnO–Ag planar configuration) and it was observed that the dark current value got reduced by more than ten times with Cr coating, thereby opening up its potential for transistor applications.

In the past very few groups have demonstrated the usage of PPC effect for applications in the field of bioelectronics, optical switching, holography and photonic devices. It was observed that using deep UV illumination the device (λ = 254 nm) could be set easily, while the reset process required the device to be illuminated by λ = 800 nm NIR light.

    "title": "TOMBSTONING  Looks like it’s n just the Undertaker!",
    "content": "Introduction\r\n Tombstoning (also known as Manhattan effect or crocodile effect) usually affects surface\r\n mount passive components such as resistors, capacitors and inductors. It is where one end\r\n of the component lifts from a pad of the PCB during the soldering process.\r\n Causes\r\n To understand the causes, we will have to understand an integral part of the soldering\r\n process known as Wetting.\r\n Wetting is where the Solder paste becomes fluid or molten and is able to attach itself to the\r\n component terminal and to the pad on the PCB. The ideal situation is when all the\r\n terminals of a component complete the Wetting process at the same time creating a solid\r\n physical and electrical inter-metallic bond. It is important as when the Solder paste becomes\r\n fluid it applies a pulling force to each of the component terminals, known as the Meniscus\r\n Pull, something like a Tug-of-War on the component.\r\nThis pulling force has the benefit of helping self-center the component between its pads if\r\n the Wetting process is completed at the same time.\r\n Basically, the pad that completes the Wetting process first will win the Tug-of-War and may\r\n pull the component vertically resulting in Tombstoning. What it really comes down to is the\r\n difference in thermal mass between pads of the same component. This will define how\r\n quickly the Solder paste is heated and becomes fluid then, how quickly the heat dissipates\r\n and the solder becomes solid.\r\n Apart from the manufacturing troubles(which apparently are not in our control), some of\r\n the common mistakes that we can take care of to avoid tombstoning of our PCB are listed\r\n below.\r\n PCB Layout mistakes:\r\n Footprint and Pad sizes\r\nIf the pad sizes for your small passive parts are incorrect, it could affect the thermal mass\r\n of the solder joints. A pad with less mass will cause the solder to reflow sooner than larger\r\n pads.\r\n Along with building pads to the correct size, it's also imperative to ensure the entire\r\n footprint for the passive parts is correct. Pads also require the correct pitch(pad spacing)\r\n and identical size pads for both the terminals of the component.\r\n In short, always make sure that you make your component footprints according to the\r\n exact specifications in your manufacturer’s datasheet.\r\n Pads connected to large copper areas:\r\n Large copper areas act as Heat Sinks and therefore connecting a component pad to one as\r\n in the graphics above would most likely result in Tombstoning.\r\n Avoid multiple tracks to one pad and only one track to the other pad different track widths\r\n to pads of the same component, also avoid different track widths to pads of the same component. A pad with multiple tracks connected to it will dissipate the heat quicker than\r\n with the pad with a single track connected to it. Therefore, the Wetting process will be\r\n completed at different times which may result in Tombstoning.\r\n When a pad is connected to Power or GND it is common for larger tracks to be used as\r\n above. However, this will result in the Wetting process for the pad with the larger track\r\n being completed before the pad with the thinner track and may result in Tombstoning. The\r\n aim is to make the track width to each pad of the component the same width. An important\r\n point to consider is that this unified track width must be run at least 0.25mm from the pad\r\n edge before the width changes to help keep the Wetting process in sync.\r\n There are multiple other layout issues but the basic ones are mentioned above. Again, the\r\n rule of thumb is to keep the track width to each pad of the component the same width!!\r\n-See you next time with yet another knowledge bomb. Until then,\r\n keep the clock ticking!",

    "title": "Bouncing Not a ball but a “switchˮ",
    "content": "What is a Switch Bounce?\r\n When you push a button, press a micro switch, or flip a toggle switch, two metal \r\nparts come together. For the user, it might seem that the contact is made instantly. \r\nHowever, that is not quite correct. Inside the switch, there are moving parts. When \r\nyou push the switch, it initially makes brief contact with the other metal part for \r\njust a split microsecond. Then it makes contact for a little longer, and again for a \r\nlittle longer. Eventually, the switch is fully closed. During this process, the switch \r\nbounces between making contact and not making contact.\r\n \"When the switch is closed, the two contacts actually separate and reconnect, \r\ntypically 10 to 100 times over a period of about 1ms\" (\"The Art of Electronics,\" \r\nHorowitz & Hill, Second Edition, pg. 506). Usually, the hardware operates faster \r\nthan the bouncing, causing the hardware to register multiple presses. This \r\nhardware is often an integrated circuit. \r\nHow to reduce bouncing?\r\n Bouncing\r\n Adding Capacitor \r\n Capacitor acts like a filter, it smoothens out the \r\nwaveforms. \r\nSoftware Debouncing \r\n When working with microcontrollers, we can deal with \r\nswitch bounce in a different way that will save both hardware space and \r\nmoney. Some programmers do not care much about bouncing switches and \r\njust add a 50ms delay after the first bounce. This will force the microcontroller \r\nto wait 50ms for the bouncing to stop, and then continue with the program. \r\nConclusion\r\n This article was all about bouncing of switch, how it affects your system, and \r\ndifferent ways to deal with it. The examples that are used are very simple, but they \r\nshould give you a feeling of what is happening when you push a switch. You \r\nshould always consider switch bounce when you are designing a  system.",
